# Fiat Panda 100HP-TJet Wiring Conversion
## Justification
The Fiat Panda 100HP (169.A3000) was released with a naturally aspirated 1.4 16V engine. While the engine does a great job of getting you from A to B, it is doesn't give you the umphf you would like from a hot hatch. I therefore decided to try and engine swap my Panda. 

Fiat have provided us with a vast range of hot hatch cars with varying levels of power. The beautiful thing about that is that the basis of these powerhouses are from the 169.A3000 engine (this is not a literal quote or something but my assumption). The engine in question has had several revisions for the different line up of cars. At the heart of them all, there are two categories to choose from; TJet and Multiair. 

They have their differences which I won't outline here, but the key take away is that the TJet is the easiest and most straight forward method for turbo charging your Fiat Panda 100HP. 


## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to make the process of converting your Fiat Panda 1.4 100HP to a Fiat/Abarth TJet turbo engine. The actual process of putting the turbo engine into the Fiat Panda 100HP is actually very straight forward, the wiring however is what stops a lot of people from taking on this challenge. 

After plenty of research and development, I have created a plug and play solution for this problem, removing any need to do anything in terms of wiring the car. 

It is, of course, possible to rewire the Panda 100HP "Body" side plug to use the TJet engine computer management (also known as ECU or ECM). This method however scares people, but it can be done fairly straight forward. 

In the project, I have the wiring diagram that I have made using Wireviz. This tool allows you to create a wiring diagram using a YAML file. The diagram is output in several different methods allowing you to view the diagram on all sorts of platforms.
