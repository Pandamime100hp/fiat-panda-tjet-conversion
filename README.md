# fiat-panda-tjet-conversion
The Fiat Panda 100HP (169.A3000) was released with a naturally aspirated 1.4 16V engine. While the engine does a great job of getting you from A to B, it is doesn't give you the umphf you would like from a hot hatch. I therefore decided to try and engine swap my Panda. 

Fiat have provided us with a vast range of hot hatch cars with varying levels of power. The beautiful thing about that is that the basis of these powerhouses are from the 169.A3000 engine (this is not a literal quote or something but my assumption). The engine in question has had several revisions for the different line up of cars. At the heart of them all, there are two categories to choose from; TJet and Multiair. 

They have their differences which I won't outline here, but the key take away is that the TJet is the easiest and most straight forward method for turbo charging your Fiat Panda 100HP.
